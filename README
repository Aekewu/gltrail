1. Install qt4-development packages and qmake
   (sudo apt-get install qt4-dev-tools)
2. qmake -unix -o Makefile gltrail.pro && make
3. cp gltrail.ini-example gltrail.ini
   (and replace with your information)
4. ./bin/gltrail gltrail.ini

Note: You'll need public-key ssh access set up to your servers,
      as I haven't found a good/free cross-platform ssh library.
